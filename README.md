# project-1
Group Project-I:  IT-Front end developer course, Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola.

In order to make our project successful, we need to follow these steps:

Create a github repository.    

Invite team members to participate.

Everyone will clone the repository to their local machine.

There should be one page for each member to work on.
    
The first step is to create a landing page structure.
    
On their working pages, other team members will follow that structure.
    
Check the code on your local machine before merging a branch/committing and pushing.
    
The project/repository will consist of the following files/directories:  

Html file (Landing-page): index.html 

Folder-1 (For all html-pages, except index.html): pages

Folder-2 (For all images and logo): images

Folder-3 (For style-sheet): style
